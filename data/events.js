Before the group heads back to the con, participants will be free to explore the mall or join for a dinner (paid individually) or if they desire they may head back early to the con themselves if they don't want to wait for the rest of the group. For those heading back alone, simply follow the shopping street all the way back from Triangeln to Malmö Central Station and you'll be able to spot Malmö Live on your left.\r\nThis tour will take approximately 5 hours and is 4 km long. We will spend time both outdoors and indoors, so please dress accordingly. In the Telegram group NFC Nerd Herd you can hang out and chat, and it will also be where updates are posted on the event. If you wish to be added to the chat or to fursuit during the event, please send a Telegram message to @Hypter.",
