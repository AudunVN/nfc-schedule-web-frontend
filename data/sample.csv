Well, a secret santa is like a big gift exchange! There are multiple versions of it, but the thing we will do to keep things simple, is that everyone turns in a gift, then, when it’s time for everyone to unbox their gift, each and everyone will have recieved a ticket with a number on (also used as proof of you turning a gift in) When you get to pick a package, it will be like a big lottery! But everyone will get something! ","30 minutes before and 30 minutes after. Event should last around one (1) hour, making it 2 hours in total!","Would be fun to have Golf! Since we will be at least 25 people. If we become more, we probably need a bigger room!","If we only become 25 people, it will probably wont be needed! But just in case, A microphone and some speakers","chairs and tables","No","yes, one atleast","Good to have, so 1.","Have you heard? There will be a secret santa held during nfc! So bring your friends along for a merry time!

But what do you need to do and get?
Step 1: A gift worth between 50-150 sek (you may go over but keep in mind that you might then not receive the same value back!)

Step 2: Turn your gift in to conops and you will receive a ticket with a number on (like a lottery ticket) You get to keep one half of that number, the other you put in the big red mailbox made out of cardboard at conops! Please write your email or telegram on the backside!

Step 3: Wait for the gift exchange to start! Once your number has been pulled (be there or else you will get one of the leftover gifts!), you get to pick a package from the pile we will have.

Step 4: Enjoy your gift! Happy howliday!","","","Could be fun!

Here's what I've already said to them:

I perform live original electronic music using a laptop, keyboards, and other cool looking devices that light up. I also play a keytar and use a vocoder with my vocals. I've performed at ConFuzzled and a couple of times at FinFur Animus, and now that I know I'll be attending NFC, hopefully there too for the first time.

My show is about 45 minutes long, so an hour slot in the schedule would be ideal, preferably in the evening. The audience appreciates having both room to sit and room to dance. The audio comes from a single 3.5mm output which will go to the in-house setup. One power socket would be needed on-stage. I would appreciate two microphones; one for a live singer (if you have a specialised microphone for singing, that would be perfect), and one microphone for talking to the audience.","Minimum 30 minutes.","Yes, definitely need a stage. Vincent said it would be possible to perform on the main stage before the first DJ one evening.","The audio comes from a single 3.5mm output which will go to the in-house setup.

Same requirements as regular dances.","I haven't reached such celebrity status yet.","My crystal ball can't see that far into the future, sorry.","Dalziel brings his live original electronic music show to NFC for the first time! From synthwave to future bass, trance to cheesy 90s-style dance, there's something for everyone to enjoy. Do you enjoy drifting to eurobeat? Dalziel has you covered! With his trusty keytar and aided by live guest singers, the English dragon promises a memorable and entertaining show. Come along and dance, or just sit and listen - however you want to do it, just enjoy the show!","I know some of the details about this event have already been discussed with Fredrix and Vincent, but I remember Fredrix saying at the STEW weekend that this form should still be filled in, and he emphasised it again in the recent mewsletter!

I am also aware that I will likely be sent another form to fill in (I did read the above notice) but I can reuse the responses :)

Great fun. :)","Allow at least 30 minutes to get everything running, especially if the speakers are not permanent and pre-tested. Same for teardown. The biggest potential slowdowns are getting the audio system into a good state and getting the karaoke laptop to cooperate. Thankfully, the event is not too fussy about start and end times.","Fur-e-oke is generally the last event of the night, commonly scheduled from 22:00 to 01:00, though in practice it usually keeps going until around 02:00. Good times are Friday night or later, with at least one empty night between this event and the other Fur-e-oke event. There needs to be a performance area (which may or may not be a raised stage) with plenty of audience seating facing it. Attendance is generally sufficient that the Fur-e-oke doesn't feel out-of-place on the main stage, but the arrangement in Golf or Foxtrot in 2018 using the hotel's movable speakers also worked fine.
One interesting idea is to host the second fur-e-oke on Dead Dog night. ScotiaCon combined Fur-e-oke with a dance for its Dead Dog party, with attendees dancing to the songs sung by the fur-e-okes.","Karaoke needs a projector for showing lyrics, a good audio system (for music + singing), and two wireless hand-held microphones (for duets, and as a spare). The projector needs to be connected to a dedicated karaoke laptop, contributed by the organisers (HDMI) or Trax (VGA?), located at the side of the stage, which is used to find songs and manipulate the playlist and the loudness. A smaller screen facing the stage/singer might be a nice upgrade, so that the singer can face the audience during the performance.","Trax's karaoke laptop (as a backup). This laptop is current not in the possession of the panel organisers. A lectern or table at the side of the stage for the laptop to stand on, with two chairs.","No special accomodation for fursuiters needed, unless the event is combined with dancing.","No.","No.","It's once again time to let out your inner animal and howl/meow/chirp/rawr along to classic songs of all genres (not just winter holiday music)!

The first part will be the riddles, the teams gets a few days to figure them out, and then on saturday evening (preferably) They will hand in their riddles. Depending on how many answers they get correct, they get to move on to the next part, the puzzles.

The puzzles will be timed, so let's say if they do something wrong, I'll add a few seconds on their total time.

If they fail or win they will get an achievement! I have already spoken with the blip masters about this, and they gave me green light.

On the closing ceremony, the team who did the best will be announced and get a diploma + their treasure.

RESPONSE: We will at the very least make a few announcements in the internal Telegram chats, once we know the time and day for sure. If there are any other ways to inform about internal events, I would like this to be included there. If there's an internal schedule, it should be included there.

- Any sound/music going on in the background, look through AV equipment?
RESPONSE:  We will have lounge music in the background. I will most likely have access to a laptop and a portable speaker, which is more than sufficient. Will inform if this is not the case.

- Will paper plates, wine glasses (plastic, presumably) and other items be offered by you, the host, or shall NFC provide for it?
RESPONSE: NFC should (preferably) provide it, as it's an event for the STEW.

- Any ice needed for the wine (in case white wine or sparkling)?

Might help to have a table or tube-tree to display puppets if they are not being used, but can use chairs or the bag they will be in.","A stage is not necessary, but there needs to be space for people to move around and try out the puppets.

I think this is a good way to serve the interest of puppeteering without having a big stage event like ConFuzzled and Eurofurence.","","Puppets can make a great photo op.
