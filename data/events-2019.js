In the previous years, NFC has organised excursions to Stockholm giving you the chance to see the zoo, the historical museum at Skansen, the centre of town by day and by the scary ghost-filled night. But there is one place we have not yet taken you! This year, you get the chance to see the picturesque winter city from the waterside!\nThis year's excursion will be a grand triplet of the amazing waterfront of the capital of Sweden, the unique flavours of traditional Swedish food in a massive Smörgåsbord and a boat trip, seeing the winter sun set over Stockholm and how the winter lights of the magic city make the snow twinkles in the dark. No refunds if the Aurora Borealis is not seen though.","location":"Lobby","startTime":"2019-02-26T13:40:00Z","endTime":"2019-02-26T19:00:00Z","eventTags":["excursion","food"]},{"title":"Maid Café Training and meet and greet","description":"No","location":"Foxtrot","startTime":"2019-02-27T17:00:00Z","endTime":"2019-02-27T18:00:00Z","eventTags":["meet_and_greet","operations"]},{"title":"Steven Universe meet and greet","description":"All Steven Universe fans come by, lets have fun, lets talk, lets look at fan art, maybe watch something!","location":"Secluded Panel","startTime":"2019-02-28T12:30:00Z","endTime":"2019-02-28T14:00:00Z","eventTags":["meet_and_greet"]},{"title":"Glögg and fika sampling","description":"Did you get a ticket for the glögg sampling?
