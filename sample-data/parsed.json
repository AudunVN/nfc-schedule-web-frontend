    "internal_description": "First of all, what is a secret santa and why are we doing this? Well, a secret santa is like a big gift exchange! There are multiple versions of it, but the thing we will do to keep things simple, is that everyone turns in a gift, then, when it’s time for everyone to unbox their gift, each and everyone will have recieved a ticket with a number on (also used as proof of you turning a gift in) When you get to pick a package, it will be like a big lottery! But everyone will get something!",

So bring your friends along for a merry time!\n\nBut what do you need to do and get?\nStep 1: A gift worth between 50-150 sek (you may go over but keep in mind that you might then not receive the same value back!)\n\nStep 2: Turn your gift in to conops and you will receive a ticket with a number on (like a lottery ticket) You get to keep one half of that number, the other you put in the big red mailbox made out of cardboard at conops! Please write your email or telegram on the backside!\n\nStep 3: Wait for the gift exchange to start! Once your number has been pulled (be there or else you will get one of the leftover gifts!), you get to pick a package from the pile we will have.\n\nStep 4: Enjoy your gift! Happy howliday!",

    "internal_description": "I've already spoken with Fredrix and Vincent about this. Here's what I've already said to them:\n\nI perform live original electronic music using a laptop, keyboards, and other cool looking devices that light up. I also play a keytar and use a vocoder with my vocals. I've performed at ConFuzzled and a couple of times at FinFur Animus, and now that I know I'll be attending NFC, hopefully there too for the first time.\n\nMy show is about 45 minutes long, so an hour slot in the schedule would be ideal, preferably in the evening. The audience appreciates having both room to sit and room to dance. The audio comes from a single 3.5mm output which will go to the in-house setup. One power socket would be needed on-stage. I would appreciate two microphones; one for a live singer (if you have a specialised microphone for singing, that would be perfect), and one microphone for talking to the audience.",

    "description": "Dalziel brings his live original electronic music show to NFC for the first time! From synthwave to future bass, trance to cheesy 90s-style dance, there's something for everyone to enjoy. Do you enjoy drifting to eurobeat? Dalziel has you covered! With his trusty keytar and aided by live guest singers, the English dragon promises a memorable and entertaining show. Come along and dance, or just sit and listen - however you want to do it, just enjoy the show!",

I have performed live at ConFuzzled and FinFur Animus and would be happy to give you more information about what I've done in the past, and what I'm planning to do for NFC 2019.",

    "Setup/Teardown time": "Allow at least 30 minutes to get everything running, especially if the speakers are not permanent and pre-tested. Same for teardown. The biggest potential slowdowns are getting the audio system into a good state and getting the karaoke laptop to cooperate. Thankfully, the event is not too fussy about start and end times.",
    "Size": "Fur-e-oke is generally the last event of the night, commonly scheduled from 22:00 to 01:00, though in practice it usually keeps going until around 02:00. Good times are Wednesday or Thursday night, with at least one empty night between this event and the other Fur-e-oke event. There needs to be a performance area (which may or may not be a raised stage) with plenty of audience seating facing it. Attendance is generally sufficient that the Fur-e-oke doesn't feel out-of-place on the main stage, but the arrangement in Golf or Foxtrot in 2018 using the hotel's movable speakers also worked fine.",
    "AV equipment": "Karaoke needs a projector for showing lyrics, a good audio system (for music + singing), and two wireless hand-held microphones (for duets, and as a spare). The projector needs to be connected to a dedicated karaoke laptop, contributed by the organisers (HDMI) or Trax (VGA?), located at the side of the stage, which is used to find songs and manipulate the playlist and the loudness. A smaller screen facing the stage/singer might be a nice upgrade, so that the singer can face the audience during the performance.",

    "internal_description": "Attendees register their interest in singing karaoke to certain songs. They/their songs are added to a queue. When their song is up, they go on stage and sing it. Great fun. :)",
    "Setup/Teardown time": "Allow at least 30 minutes to get everything running, especially if the speakers are not permanent and pre-tested. Same for teardown. The biggest potential slowdowns are getting the audio system into a good state and getting the karaoke laptop to cooperate. Thankfully, the event is not too fussy about start and end times.",
    "Size": "Fur-e-oke is generally the last event of the night, commonly scheduled from 22:00 to 01:00, though in practice it usually keeps going until around 02:00. Good times are Friday night or later, with at least one empty night between this event and the other Fur-e-oke event. There needs to be a performance area (which may or may not be a raised stage) with plenty of audience seating facing it. Attendance is generally sufficient that the Fur-e-oke doesn't feel out-of-place on the main stage, but the arrangement in Golf or Foxtrot in 2018 using the hotel's movable speakers also worked fine.\nOne interesting idea is to host the second fur-e-oke on Dead Dog night. ScotiaCon combined Fur-e-oke with a dance for its Dead Dog party, with attendees dancing to the songs sung by the fur-e-okes.",
    "AV equipment": "Karaoke needs a projector for showing lyrics, a good audio system (for music + singing), and two wireless hand-held microphones (for duets, and as a spare). The projector needs to be connected to a dedicated karaoke laptop, contributed by the organisers (HDMI) or Trax (VGA?), located at the side of the stage, which is used to find songs and manipulate the playlist and the loudness. A smaller screen facing the stage/singer might be a nice upgrade, so that the singer can face the audience during the performance.",

If there are any other ways to inform about internal events, I would like this to be included there. If there's an internal schedule, it should be included there.\n\n- Any sound/music going on in the background, look through AV equipment?\nRESPONSE:  We will have lounge music in the background. I will most likely have access to a laptop and a portable speaker, which is more than sufficient. Will inform if this is not the case.\n\n- Will paper plates, wine glasses (plastic, presumably) and other items be offered by you, the host, or shall NFC provide for it?\nRESPONSE: NFC should (preferably) provide it, as it's an event for the STEW.\n\n- Any ice needed for the wine (in case white wine or sparkling)?\nRESPONSE: Appreciated, but not really needed. People will bring their own wines when the event starts, so there won't be much time to allow for them to chill.",

In the previous years, NFC has organised excursions to Stockholm giving you the chance to see the zoo, the historical museum at Skansen, the centre of town by day and by the scary ghost-filled night. But there is one place we have not yet taken you! This year, you get the chance to see the picturesque winter city from the waterside!\nThis year's excursion will be a grand triplet of the amazing waterfront of the capital of Sweden, the unique flavours of traditional Swedish food in a massive Smörgåsbord and a boat trip, seeing the winter sun set over Stockholm and how the winter lights of the magic city make the snow twinkles in the dark. No refunds if the Aurora Borealis is not seen though.",

(Someone with stage experience is welcome to join, but they would have to bring the relevant puppets.)",
    "Setup/Teardown time": "No set up time. Might help to have a table or tube-tree to display puppets if they are not being used, but can use chairs or the bag they will be in.",
    "Size": "A stage is not necessary, but there needs to be space for people to move around and try out the puppets. A well-lit open-plan area or room is preferable (ideally not the smallest rooms overlooking the main atrium). Maybe the long gallery where registration was last year? Or somewhere passers-by can see and interact, because part of the fun is entertaining others.",
    "AV equipment": "No (I thought of a slide presentation, but it's probably best just demonstrated)",
    "Other equipment": "Puppets! I can bring nine: one tiny hand-puppets; many one-hand puppets of various kind, and one two-handed ferret; but more would be welcome - I know a few people have made character puppets. Small props could help, too, such as those bowls full of coins, little toys, fake food, whatever you have laying about.",
    "Fursuiting": "Not really. Fursuiters are welcome to visit/join in, and could be useful for demonstrating interaction with fursuiters, but not required. We'll have our own mini-fursuits on our hands! A small fan *might* be useful to cool/dry the puppets but is not necessary.",

    "Comments, questions and/or further info": "I've not run this event before, but I've been doing this kind of puppeteering for over a decade at many conventions, so I have lots of experience on what to do (and what doesn't work so well).
